# Happiness Adopter
Our website aims to give a place to the pets whom their owners can't take care of them anymore, so instead of being abandoned the pet can find a new home and a new owner. The Website also provides a page for announcements, so if you have lost your pet you can make an announcement, and anyone who can help well contact you
